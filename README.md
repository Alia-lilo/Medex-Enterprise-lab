## 📖 Project Overview

This is a training project I created for myself to apply everything I’ve learned so far in both networking and system administration. I wish I could build a larger, more complex environment, but I was limited by my laptop’s performance, so I divided the project into two interconnected parts: network infrastructure and server services. 


💻 On the networking side, I implemented and tested core concepts and protocols.

💻 On the system side, I configured a wide range of Windows Server services.

The project scenario is built to simulate a realistic enterprise environment, with my laptop acting as the internet source (similar to an ISP router). Inside the laptop, I built a full lab in EVE-NG, including routers, switches, and servers. A FortiGate firewall serves as the core gateway for the lab. It connects:

LAN → for the internal network (Switches, Servers).

WAN → to access the internet through the laptop.

All lab devices use FortiGate as their default gateway, and FortiGate uses the laptop’s virtual adapter as its own internet gateway.
 ```   
    However, I encountered a challenge, which is licensing limitation: the FortiGate .qcow2 image in
    EVE-NG offers only a 15-day trial license. This was impractical for me, as I work on the project 
    part-time after my full-time job. Also, I’m learning and building everything
    step-by-step, not just deploying a ready-made template.
```
To overcome this, I deployed the FortiGate.ova version as a separate VM on VMware Workstation, allowing me to work without license restrictions. This version, however, supports only three interfaces and three static routes, which limited certain advanced configurations I originally planned.

To integrate both environments, I connected the FortiGate VM with EVE-NG via **VMware's vmnet2** virtual network. As a result, **FortiGate is like a secure bridge between the virtual lab (Eve) and the internet** through my laptop, completing the hybrid setup.

# 🔷 2. Network Design & Planning
![Section Header Image](images/part-2.jpg)

## 🔹IP Addressing & VLSM Design
Everything is documented in detail because I want it to be perfect.

After finishing the entire plan, I often realize that I need a larger subnet here or a different range there — and I end up redoing the whole addressing scheme from scratch. And that’s totally fine.

**Here’s my advice for anyone building their own VLSM design:**

Do it manually first. Don’t rely on online calculators right away.
When you train your mind and eyes to calculate subnets yourself, you’ll quickly start spotting typos or incorrect values — and, more importantly, you’ll understand why each subnet was assigned the way it was.

Later, you can double-check your work using tools, but your foundation will be much stronger.

**Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** was applied to the networks  `172.16.16.0/24, 172.16.17.0/24`

The addressing strategy was designed based on each department’s size, number of devices, and purpose, with careful planning to minimize IP waste and allow for future scalability.
Later, you can double-check your work using tools, but your foundation will be much stronger.

Note: `My real-world experience with company organizational structures is still limited, but this project was a great opportunity to practice practical design logic.`

## 🔹 Lab Network Infrastructure Overview

We'll install FortiGate and EVE-NG as VMs on VMware Workstation.

I’ll briefly explain the plan, then we’ll continue together, step by step, following the network diagram.

- We will use **three network adapters** in VMware:

  1. `bridged` — for Internet access.  
  2. `VMnet2` — the core network that links the project: EVE-NG, FortiGate, and the host.  
  3. `VMnet5` — dedicated to the lab inside EVE-NG.
   
- **FortiGate VM** — three network adapters:
  1. `bridged` — connect to the host for Internet access.  
  2. `VMnet2` — connect to the core network.  
  3. `VMnet5` — connect to the lab.

- **EVE-NG VM** — three network adapters:
  1. `bridged` — connect to the Internet (for updates/tools).  
  2. `VMnet2` — connect to the core network.  
  3. `VMnet5` — connect to the lab.

Inside EVE-NG:  
We'll create **two cloud networks** (`VMnet2` and `VMnet5`) to ensure full connectivity between the EVE lab, the FGT VM, and the host.  

📄 We'll go ahead according to the network diagram, following the next steps..  ⬇️
